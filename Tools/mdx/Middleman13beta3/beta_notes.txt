The only thing added in this release is the specular power fix.

When middleman finds a material and modifies it, it writes a comment next to it like so....

  Material Mtl__10 {
  0.588000; 0.588000; 0.588000; 1.000000;;
  77.000 ;  //                               << Modified By Middleman 1.3 >>  
  1.000000; 1.000000; 1.000000;;


I`ve tested the specular fix on several of my files and it works fine, it may be worth just checking that
<< Modified By Middleman 1.3 >> only appears next to the specular powers in the x file. If it appears elsewhere
be sure to let me know.
