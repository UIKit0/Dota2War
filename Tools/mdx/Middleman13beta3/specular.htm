		<H3>Specular Highlights (Dynamic Shine) using GMAX 1.2 Material Editor, Middleman 
			1.3 and MDL Commander</H3>
		<P><IMG height="471" alt="" src="mated.jpg" width="365"></P>
		<P>In the image of the material editor in gmax 1.2:</P>
		<P><STRONG>1 : This is the Specular power </STRONG>
		</P>
		<P><STRONG>2: This is the specular colour, use this to set the specular colour when the 
				material does NOT&nbsp;have a texture loaded into the diffuse channel.</STRONG></P>
		<P><STRONG>3: Use the diffuse colour to set the specular colour when the material HAS a 
				texture loaded into the diffuse channel.</STRONG></P>
		<P><STRONG>(Note : The 2 items with a red X by them won`t have any effect on the 
				specular highlight in FS2002 )</STRONG></P>
		<P>The reason for the above (3) is that the exporter sets the proper specular 
			colour to white when a texture is loaded into the diffuse channel, regardless 
			of the colour in number 2, middleman will in this case replace the specular 
			colour with the diffuse colour before send the file for compiling.</P>
		<P>Thats about it for inside GMAX.</P>
		<P><STRONG>The Export:</STRONG></P>
		<P><STRONG>Make sure you have mdl commander installed (see main readme)</STRONG></P>
		<P><STRONG><IMG alt="" src="mman.jpg"></STRONG></P>
		<P><STRONG>The new options added to middleman are only enabled when the save X file 
				open is selected.</STRONG></P>
		<P><STRONG>The 2 new options are, </STRONG>
		</P>
		<P><STRONG>Fix Specular - This will tell middleman to correct the specular power and 
				colour in the X file&nbsp; so it matches&nbsp;whats entered in the gmax 
				material editor</STRONG></P>
		<P><STRONG>Compile X File - This will tell middleman to send the X file to makemdl once 
				its&nbsp;applied the specular fix (&nbsp;pretty much the same as the&nbsp;MDL 
				commander No Compile option)</STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P><STRONG>Now all thats left to do is hit GO.</STRONG></P>
