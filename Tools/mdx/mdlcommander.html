<h1>MDLCommander v1.03<br>
               </h1>
                 This program is an interface between the gmax export plugin
  FSModelExp.dle       and MakeMDL.exe. It's purpose is to save and allow
modification  of makemdl      parameters for any model created and exported
with gmax as  well as intercepting     the exported x-files to make exports
easier in final  stages of developement     and to be able to offer models
in a way i do for  my MoriartyDock Hangar   model.  It is a batch program,
that is it doesn't  popup with a dialog.<br>

<h3>Version 1.03 - 07/02/2002</h3>
   
<ul>
    <li>bug fixed: blanks in path names of output file are now treated correct. 
Note: don't use blanks in the file name, just in the path part since makemdl 
seems to have a problem with blanks in the file name.</li>
   <li>found a way to pass the -latlon parameter correctly with blank in
coordinates (<a href="#latlon">see here</a>).<br>
   </li>
   
</ul>
   
<h3>Version 1.02</h3>
         
<ul>
       <li>optimized for use with Middleman. If you are using Middleman,
get   the new version too from <a href="http://thegreatptmd.tripod.com">Chris
File's</a>  site.</li>
       <li>added +batch and +nocompile option<br>
       </li>

<h2><a name="Installation"></a>Installation</h2>
            <b>Without</b> using <a
 href="http://thegreatptmd.tripod.com" target="_blank">Middleman  by Chris
File</a> :<br>
            <br>
            Use windows explorer and navigate to your gmax plugins folder.
 Rename     the   original makemdl.exe to mkmdl.exe. Then copy MDLCommander.exe
 to  the   plugins   folder and rename it to makemdl.exe, so that mdlcommander 
  gets  called  instead   of the original makemdl.<br>
            <br>
            Export pipeline will be: gmax -&gt; fsmodelexp -&gt; mdlcommander 
  -&gt;   makemdl<br>
            <br>
            <b>With</b> using <a href="http://thegreatptmd.tripod.com"
 target="_blank">Middleman  by Chris File</a> :<br>
             <br>
            Use windows explorer and navigate to your gmax plugins folder.
 Leave    Middleman   there as 'makemdl.exe'. Rename 'makem.exe' which is
the original    Microsoft   makemdl.exe to mkmdl.exe. Copy mdlcommander.exe
there and name    mdlcommander.exe   to makem.exe. So mdlcommander will now
sit between middleman    and original   makemdl. (Note: didn't test it prior
to writing this but  this  should work   well). When using middlemen then
i recommend setting options  via middleman,   not via the .par - files for
mdlcommander (see below) except  for options  unique to mdlcommander.<br>
            <br>
            Export pipeline will be: gmax -&gt; fsmodelexp -&gt; middleman
 -&gt;    mdlcommander   -&gt; makemdl<br>
            
<h2><a name="Function"></a>Function</h2>
                 It's called instead of original makemdl and intercepts the 
 parameters      for  makemdl.exe. It looks for a file in the same directory 
 as your exported      .mdl  or .bgl file  named yourexportfile.par. ("yourexportfile"
  = name   of   your exported .mdl or .bgl  file). In this file which can
be  edited  by any   texteditor like NOTEPAD, you can place any parameter
you  want for  makemdl.exe.   These parameters are appended to the parameters
 provided by  FSModelExp and   then makemdl is called.<br>
                 That way you can always save and use the same modelspecific
  parameters      for  a certain model. They will automatically be used for
  every export   of this model once placed in the .par file.<br>
               <br>
               <b>NOTE:</b> usually makemdl is called with the -b (batch) 
parameter.      The  disadvantage  when exporting an aircraft is, that you 
can't alter   the   makemdl  options. So mdlcommander removes this parameter 
which causes   makemdl   to pop up. If you want it back in, put it in the 
yourexportfile.par   file.   Then exporting will be as seemless as it was 
before but still with   extra  parameters read from the .par file.<br>
            
<h2><a name="Parameterfile"></a>Parameterfile</h2>
                 You can write a parameterfile for every exported model.
It's   name   is  always  the name  of the exported model and the extension
.par   and it's   expected  in the same  directory where the exported model
resides.    Lines  beginning with ';' or '#'  are treated as comment lines.
Empty lines    are ignored. Additional   parameters for makemdl can be written
 in one  or  more lines. If you use one  line per parameter, it's easy to
comment  or uncomment single parameters  for tests if necessary. I usually
comment  the parameterfiles since i tend  to forget the meaning of parameters
over  time :), even if i write the programs myself.<br>
                 The parameterfile may contain makemdl parameters as well 
as  mdlcommander     parameters.<br>
   If you prefer using a dialog for that parameter stuff, i urgently recommend 
 using Middleman as mentioned above in the installation section. MDLCommander 
 doesn't rely on having a parameter file, this is optional to make life easier 
 and Middleman now offers access to MDLCommander parameters too.<br>
   <br>
                 <b>NOTE: Don't use filenames with blanks !!!</b><br>
            
<h3>Example Parameterfile:</h3>
            
<pre># these are parameters for exporting my aircraft<br># -b       shut up (batch)<br># -keep    keeps all intermediate files .asm and such<br># -i       ignore warnings<br># -i8-     do not ignore bad triggers (might be important for stock anims)<br># -in-     do not ignore bad normals<br># -viewlog view logs in case of error (only if -b deactivated)<br>-b<br>-i<br>-in-<br>-i8-<br>-keep<br>-viewlog<br>+savexfile<br><br></pre>
                  I usually switch off all the ignore-flags except warnings 
 (-i,   -in-   -i8)  since the -b option switches everything to ignore which 
 causes   makemdl   to  run through smoothly and you will never know that 
you might   have a bug   in  your object names (expecting them to animate 
but used wrong   misspelled   name  etc.).<br>
            
<h3>Example using +autointerior (see below for description of own parameters):</h3>
            
<pre># these are parameters for exporting my aircraft with automatically<br># creating the interior model file for MakeMDL<br># -b       shut up (batch)<br># -keep    keeps all intermediate files .asm and such<br># -i       ignore warnings<br># -i8-     do not ignore bad triggers (might be important for stock anims)<br># -in-     do not ignore bad normals<br># -viewlog view logs in case of error (only if -b deactivated)<br><br>-b<br>-i<br>-in-<br>-i8-<br>-keep<br>-viewlog<br>+savexfile<br>+autointerior</pre>
            
<h2><a name="Logfile_mdlcommander.log"></a>Logfile mdlcommander.log</h2>
            MDLcommander writes a logfile to the current work directory everytime
     it   is called. The current work directory usually is the directory
to   which    the model is exported. It contains information about original 
and   modified     parameters  for makemdl as well as the returncode. It's 
overwritten   everytime     you export  a model to that directory. You can 
use it for problem  detection.   If you have problems with MDLCommander, then
send me at least  this logfile   so that i can determine what might have
gone wrong.<br>
            
<h2><a name="Parameters_for_MDLCommander"></a>Parameters for MDLCommander</h2>
             MDLCommander knows a couple own parameters. In contrary to MakeMDL
   -  Parameters   they use the switch character '+' instead of '-' for easier
   recognition.<br>

 as  modelname.x    in the output directory - There you got your .x-file
!  I recommend  use this option always for a couple reasons:<br>
     I can pass then mymodel.x to makemdl which will drive it into automatically 
  adding any .x - LOD or _interior.x files to the LOD tab. Also you have something
  to look into if stuff doesn't get exported as you want it, perhaps gives
 you an idea whats wrong.<br>

                   <td valign="top">The modelfile is intercepted and saved
 as  modelname_interior.x    in the output directory. Don't use with -b switch 
  since MDLCommander can't    pass the interior file name as parameter to 
MakeMDL.  Instead when MakeMDL    pops up you have to go to the LOD - tab 
and add the  ..._interior.x file  there  to the LOD-names with the add button.<br>
             Autointerior just makes it easier to model, since you can use
 one   model    as exterior AND interior model without having to manually
copy any  files   before continuing with MakeMDL. Thats done by MDLCommander.<br>
            Note: don't set this for scenery objects - nothing bad will happen, 
  just doesn't make much sense !<br>
     Also: If the exported models name ends with ..._interior then this flag
  is ignored since mdlcommander assumes this already IS the interior model.<br>

 which  might want to re-enable the batch mode of makemdl from the commandline,

 interrupt  makemdl. If +batch is set, then mdlcommander passes a -b flag 
to makemdl and things run through smoothly. May also be placed in par files

<h2><a name="Tutorial:_How_to_Set_Up_a_Project_for"></a>Tutorial: How to
Set Up a Project for Efficient Work with MDLCommander</h2>
            Pretend you are working on a model named 'MyModel.gmax'. It should
   be  in  a folder within your FS 2002 installation like: ....\FS2002\aircraft\model\MyModel.gmax.
      Assume you just created the model. So until the model isn't anywhere
 near     finished you just need this ONE model to make outside AND inside
 (VC).        
<ol>
              <li>Open NOTEPAD and create in this folder a file named MyModel.par.
     This  step has only to be done for initial parameter setup.</li>
              <li>Copy and paste the content of one of the above example
parameterfiles       in this file and add / modify the parameters as needed
using the tables     of  parameters above.</li>
              <li>Set +savexfile and  +autointerior parameters, so you always 
  get  the  original x-file and the copy of it to MyModel_interior.x. <b>NOTE: 
  You  don't  need +autointerior for scenery objects ! </b>If you need to 
change  parameters   at a later stage, just open the file again and change 
whatever  you need.</li>
              <li>Export your model from within gmax. No need to copy and 
make   groups    from your model at this stage. MDLCommander will always save
the   x-files.    When MakeMDL pops up, go to the LOD Tab, press the ADD-Button,
  add the MyModel_interior.x   file to the LOD files (if its an aircraft).</li>
              <li>Press Start button in MakeMDL to compile the model.</li>
            
</ol>
            At a later stage, when modelling is completely finished, you
might    want   to optimize your aircraft model. Now in gmax save your full
model   to a new   file named MyModel_interior.gmax and MyModel_shadow.gmax.
Optimize    them as  needed, for example remove outer fuselage from the interior
(VC)    model. Remove  lots of details and interior from shadow model, perhaps
even   rebuild some  high poly outside stuff with fewer polys for the shadow
model.<br>
            
<ol>
              <li>Remove the +autointerior switch from the MyModel.par file.
  Now   you   got an extra model for that, so auto-copy isn't necessary anymore.
   Make sure  you have the +savexfile option in the MyModel.par file. You
now  need a par file for all models, for example MyModel.par, MyModel_interior.par 
  and MyModel_shadow.par.<br>
              </li>
              <li>To export interior and shadow model, open one of these
models    in  gmax  and export. When MakeMDL pops up, just press exit button
or use   the +nocompile option in the parameter files or from within Middleman.</li>
              <li>Open your regular (outside) model in gmax, export it OR 
just   open   MakeMDL and open there a current version of the regular MyModel.x 
  - file. When MakeMDL   pops up, go to LOD Tab and add the files MyModel_interior.x 
  and MyModel_shadow.x    there. Press the Start button and now you get an 
 optimized model for outside,    inside and the shadows and you still didn't 
 have to fiddle around with copying,   renaming objects, moving center points 
 and all that crap.</li>

<h2><a name="Advantage_of_Having_x-files"></a>Advantage of Having x-files</h2>
            You should ask that Fox and Scully.<br>
            <br>
            Actually you can use them to:<br>
            
<ul>
              <li>take a look at what's really exported, sometimes giving 
you   hints   what might be wrong with your model</li>
              <li>find some undocumented features (there are some interesting 
  things    in them).<br>
              </li>
              <li>you can publish objects like my hangar which comes as x-file.
   Only   MakeMDL is needed to place an object, NOT gmax, which is a big
advantage.       So you can publish a library of x-files as freeware placeable
with just     MakeMDL.<br>
              </li>

<h2><a name="Known_and_Potential_Problems"></a>Known and Potential Problems</h2>
            I used it now for like 200+ exports of my scenery and aircraft
 objects.     There currently is no known problem. <br>
            <br>
            BUT: <br>
            
<ul>
              <li>using it on a windows other than Windows 2000 might cause 
 problems     due to the use of very low level windows API functions, drop 
 me a note  if   you have that sort of problem.</li>
              <li>intercepting the x-file involves decryption with translation
   tables.    These tables might still not be correct for all possible characters.
   I only   once found a problem after i finished the initial version, but
 there  might   still be problems with some special characters. I recommend
 that you use  the following characters in object names, material names and
 texture  map names (case doesn't matter): letters 'A'-'Z', numbers '0'-'9',
 '$', '_'  . Do not use any other special or national characters like umlauts
 or accents.   Do not use blanks in names.</li>
              <li>I had 2 or 3 times a problem, where MakeMDL said that interior
    is  an invalid x-file, then i just exported again and it worked well.
I  believe    though that this error is actually caused by corrupt memory
or  something.    So if you have that effect, just export again. If it persists
  though, drop    me a note and de-install mdlcommander by renaming the files
  back to original    names.</li>
