Requirements:
	DirectX 9.0 installed. You can download the DirectX runtime library from the
	Microsoft web site.


Importer Functionality:
	This program can read and load Warcraft III MDX models with their
	animations. The importer can read all the vertices information, including
	their normals, texture coordinates... A full list of all the animation sequences
	will be available.

Exporter Functionality:
	The program will export all selected geosets and the selected animation sequence
	into an MD3 file format which can be easily imported into 3D Studio Max.

How To Use:
	To import a model, click on the "Open MDX File" button and choose the model that
	you want to view. You can load up to two textures and switch between them quickly.
	Transparent areas in textures can be replace with any color you choose. The animation
	speed is just for previewing pruposes. Any exported model will have its real animation
	speed.

Problems:
	Some problems might appear in the animations with some models, especially models holding
	weapon such as the Hell Scream or Arthas. This problem is very rare though. I am still
	trying to find out why...

	If you have any trouble running the program, have any comments or even discover a bug, 
	please feel free to send me an e-mail (electrichead__ss@hotmail.com) with "Warcraft III"
	in the subject.

Enjoy... :)
