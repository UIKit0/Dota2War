# This class takes over control of the camera and sets up a Real Time Strategy game type camera control system. The user can move the camera three 
# ways. If the mouse cursor is moved to the edge of the screen, the camera will pan in that direction. If the right mouse button is held down, the 
# camera will orbit around it's target point in accordance with the mouse movement, maintaining a fixed distance. The mouse wheel will move the 
# camera closer to or further from it's target point. 

# This code was originally developed by Ninth from the Panda3D forums, and has been modified by piratePanda to achieve a few effects. 
    # First mod: Comments. I've gone through the code and added comments to explain what is doing what, and the reason for each line of code. 
    # Second mod: Name changes. I changed some names of variables and functions to make the code a bit more readable (in my opinion). 
    # Third mod: Variable pan rate. I have changed the camera panning when the mouse is moved to the edge of the screen so that the panning 
        # rate is dependant on the distance the camera has been zoomed out. This prevents the panning from appearing faster when 
        # zoomed in than when zoomed out. I have also added a pan rate variable, which could be modified by an options menu, so it is 
        # easier to give the player control over how fast the camera pans. 
    # Fourth mod: Variable pan zones. I added a variable to control the size of the zones at the edge of the screen where the camera starts 
        # panning. 
    # Fifth mod: Orbit limits: I put in a system to limit how far the camera can move along it's Y orbit to prevent it from moving below the ground 
        # plane or so high that you get a fast rotation glitch. 
    # Sixth mod: Pan limits: I put in variables to use for limiting how far the camera can pan, so the camera can't pan away from the map. These 
        # values will need to be customized to the map, so I added a function for setting them.
